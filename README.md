# 🧠 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using Langchain & IBM Granite | Edunet Foundation

Welcome! This repository showcases a practical implementation of **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** using [Langchain](https://www.langchain.com/), **IBM Granite Models**, and **Milvus Lite vector database** — built as part of my learning journey with **Edunet Foundation - IBM SKILLSBUILD INTERNSHIP** 🚀.

RAG is a clever way to make language models smarter by giving them access to real, relevant information from documents — just like looking up facts before answering a question!

## 📚 What You'll Learn

In this notebook, you'll:

* ✅ Install and set up Langchain + IBM models
* ✅ Load a custom document (State of the Union)
* ✅ Split the document into readable pieces
* ✅ Store those in a vector database
* ✅ Ask a question & retrieve the most relevant chunks
* ✅ Generate an accurate, AI-powered answer using RAG pipeline

## 🔍 Why This Project Matters

RAG is the future of **context-aware AI**. It allows you to build systems that don’t just “guess” but **know** what they’re talking about by pulling in the right information.

Whether you're working on chatbots, customer support, or document Q\&A systems — this project is your entry point.

## ✅ Outcome
By the end of this lab, I successfully built a working RAG pipeline using open tools and models. This helped me understand how language models can be extended with external knowledge — a skill that’s highly useful in real-world AI applications.
